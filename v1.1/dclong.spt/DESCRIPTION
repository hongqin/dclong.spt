Description: Permutation tests are commonly used. Usually it doesn't take much
    time to do a permutation test, but it can be time-consuming if you have to
    do many permution tests at the same time. This package allows you to do
    sequential permutation tests which save you time. Currently only sequential
    permutation test for no difference between two groups and sequential
    permutation test for no correlation between a reponse variable and a bunch
    of covariates are supported. Generally sequential permutation test (and
    parallel technic) will be supported soon.
